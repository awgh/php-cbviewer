PHP-CBViewer is a web-based viewer for .cbr and .cbz "comic book archives".

Features:
- Lightweight, no cruft.
- Uses just the filesystem, no database required.
- Supports extensions: cbr, cbz, rar, zip, pdf, and txt.
- "Next Comic" button skips to next comic for binge reading.
- Page rotation for tablets (still buggy on some browsers)
- Touchscreen/Scrollwheel friendly
- Site-level password option with IP Subnet Whitelisting

Requirements: 
PHP/RAR library (http://us.php.net/manual/en/rar.installation.php)
PHP/Zip library (http://us3.php.net/manual/en/zip.installation.php)
PHP/GD library (http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php)

Setup:

1) Create a cache directory, which is web-accessible, in the same directory as config.php.  
On Ubuntu:
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/comics/cache

2) Give the cache directory sufficient permissions that the web server process can write to it (777, or chown()ed to the process owner of apache).  
On Ubuntu: 
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/comics/cache

3) Enter the basename of this directory (e.g., "cache") for $webcache in config.php.

4) Enter the full path to your comics directory for $base in config.php.  This directory does
not need to be web-accessible, but must be readable by the web server process.
