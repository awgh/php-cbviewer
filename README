php-cbviewer
version 0.1

PHP-CBViewer is a web-based viewer for .cbr and .cbz "comic book archives".  It utilizes the ZIP and RAR extensions to PHP, and maintains minimal filesystem usage by flushing its cache directory on each new pageload.  At present it is only suitable for single-user installations, due to this cache-control mechanism.


Requirements: 
PHP/RAR library (http://us.php.net/manual/en/rar.installation.php)
PHP/Zip library (http://us3.php.net/manual/en/zip.installation.php)
Note that you may need to install a pcre library in order to compile the zip library. Ubuntu and similar: libpcre3-dev, OS X Lion via Brew: pcre

Setup:
Edit config.php after making the following configurations:

1) Create a cache directory, which is web-accessible, to contain the current page.  This cache directory must have the same parent directory as config.php.  Give the cache directory sufficient permissions that the web server process can write to it (777, or chown()ed to the process owner of apache).  Note that at present, when any page is loaded, everything else in this directory is deleted.  Enter the basename of this directory (e.g., "cache") for $webcache in config.php.

2) Create a directory, which does not need to be web-accessible but does need to have sufficient permissions that the web server process can READ it (at least 555).  Put all of your .cbr/.cbz files in this directory.  Complex filesystem structures are OK; php-cbviewer will descend the filesystem tree.  Enter the full path to this directory for $base in config.php.
